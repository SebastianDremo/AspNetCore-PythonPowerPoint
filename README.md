# AspNetCore-PythonPowerPoint
WebApi with PowerPoint automation written with Python 

Made just to show how to work with Python in C# 

Idea here is to request HttpGet from asp.net core webapi and in result get Power Point demo presentation made with Python script.

I used python here because it is easier to find documentation of libraries for automating Power Point than in Microsoft's C#

## If you want to run this on your enviroment there is a couple of things need to be done before. 

### 1. Install Python at least 3.7 ( newest at the moment ) 
### 2. Install Python-pptx library https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
### 3. Change path to your python.exe in PresentationController
### 4. Now all should work correctly
