# AspNetCore-PythonPowerPoint
WebApi with PowerPoint automation written with Python 

Idea here is to request HttpGet from asp.net core webapi and in result get Power Point demo presentation made with Python script.

I used python here because it is easier to find documentation of libraries for automating Power Point than in Microsoft's C#
